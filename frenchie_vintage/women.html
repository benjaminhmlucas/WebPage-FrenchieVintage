				<li>All items in VINTAGE CONDITION: Pre-owned goods may show minor signs of wear due to age. I always indicate any major flaws or blemishes, but tiny signs of wear (pilling, pinholes, fading) are normal with vintage items.</li>

				<li>Sizing info: To ensure a good fit, it is recommended that you compare measurements of your own clothing to the ones in the listings. That will give you a good idea of what measurements are right for you. If you need any extra measurements, just ask!</li>
