Our inventory is curated from a wide variety of sources.  Our stock includes rare items that go as far back as the early 1900's.  Items such as shirts, pants, sweaters, vests, and jackets.

				<li>Sizing info: To ensure a good fit, it is recommended that you compare measurements of your own clothing to the ones in the listings. That will give you a good idea of what measurements are right for you. If you need any extra measurements, just ask!</li>
