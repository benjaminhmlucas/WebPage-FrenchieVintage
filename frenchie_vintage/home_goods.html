		<h1>Vintage Home Goods</h1>
			<p>In a world where a lot of things have gone from handmade to mass produced it becomes harder and harder to find home goods that last and have a history. A handmade rocking chair your grandmother sat in on her porch, hand painted ceramic cookware that will last for several generations, or a decorative hand carved jewelry box.  In our home goods 
			section, we curate these rapidly disappearing items not only to preserve but also to share and pass on to future generations.  Preserving these items allows us to not only tell a story about where they have been but also help us to remember as we look towards where we are going. Are you planning an event and need to rent furniture with individual flare? Check out our sister site <a href="https://www.thefrencheclectic.com/" target="_blank">The French Eclectic</a>!</p>
