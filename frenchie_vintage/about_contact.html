			<h1>A bit about me:</h1> 
			<img class="aboutpic" src="images/katie.jpg" width="25%">
			<blockquote><em><strong>“The measure of your life is the amount of beauty and happiness of which you are aware.”</strong></em></blockquote>

			<p>I'm a treasure hunter and a pirate of the old and beautiful. I'm an easily excitable	person...a gal who geeks out over old found belongings, has a hat box collection 3 stories high, and still plays dress up for fun! I drink too much whiskey and eat only cheese for dinner at least 3 times a week. I find creative people intriguing and I'm inspired by the passion and energy of others.</p>

			<h1>Contact</h1>

			<p>My life is sometimes a whirlwind of chaos and awesomeness. That being said, I help to organize said whirlwind awesomeness with my computer!  The best way to reach me is	through email.  If you have questions about a product you wish to purchase, questions about a product you have already purchased, or you want to find out a little more about what it is I do you can reach me here: <span>kee829@gmail.com</span></p>
