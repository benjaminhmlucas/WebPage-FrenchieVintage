					<p class="articleText">The nostalgia, unique detailing and quality of vintage garments are what inspires this shop's collection. I curate a variety of clothing and accessories from the turn of the century through the early 1990s. Quality, style and timeless Appeal are the rules I live by. I have always been fascinated by history and how people before us lived their lives.  My shop has given me the opportunity to not only collect these items, but then share my fascination with you!</p>
					
					<p class="articleText">In the past, I have focused solely on Women’s apparel and jewelry. At the time the shop was called Little French Dress. More recently I felt a need to expand the shop to encompass more than this.  In my travels and wanderings I came across so many wonderful garments and curiosities that I can no longer ignore them and stick to women’s apparel only.  I have found many exquisite items outside my usual scope that include Men’s apparel as well as assorted home goods. With these new additions came the new name: French Vintage. I didn’t cut down on the number of Women’s apparel we had, but instead, I began stocking up on the new goods to match our current inventory. Don’t forget: Every item is unique and our inventory changes constantly. If you see something you like snag it before it’s too late!</p> 

					<p class="articleText">In the end, my mission is to find someone who will adore these pieces just as much as I do! Are you the curious gal with an eye for something different...always seeking a little piece of history? Well, I've been looking for you, it's nice to finally meet! We have no brick and mortar location so the best way to check us out is on <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/littlefrenchdress" target="_blank">Etsy</a> currently.	My physical location is Charleston so I am frequently presenting at local artisan markets there!  Check out any upcoming markets <a href="event_blog.html">here</a>. Are you planning an event and need to rent furniture with individual flare?  Check out our sister site <a href="https://www.thefrencheclectic.com/" target="_blank">The French Eclectic</a>!</p>
